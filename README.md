## Hey, I'm Richard 👋

This is mostly a place for learning, experiments, and half-finished ideas.

I work with data and like trying to understand how things actually behave rather than how the docs say they should 😄

### Lately I've been playing with
- dbt and analytics engineering patterns
- BigQuery vs DuckDB (and when each makes sense)
- Dagster for orchestration
- Incremental API ingestion in Python
- SQL for slightly awkward real-world data

### What you'll find here
- Small proof-of-concept projects
- Experiments that answered a specific question
- Notes-in-code rather than production libraries
- Some repos that exist mainly so I don’t forget things

### Things I like
- Simple systems
- Boring, reliable data pipelines
- Understanding trade-offs instead of chasing tools
- Writing SQL that future-me won’t hate

If anything here is useful to you, feel free to steal it.
