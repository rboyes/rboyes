## Richard Boyes 👋

This is mostly a place for learning, experiments, and half-finished ideas.

I work with data and like working with code and machine learning.

### What you'll find here
- Small proof-of-concept projects
- Experiments that answered a specific question
- Some repos that exist mainly so I don’t forget things

### Things I like
- Simple systems
- Boring, reliable data pipelines

If anything here is useful to you, feel free to steal it.
